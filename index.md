<h1>I'm Bithiah Koshy.</h1>

A tinkerer, pleb, old soul. 

Known as vintagemind or devargnes or 0xBithiah on the World Wide Web. I like to fence, play chess, 
read books, do [ornithology research](https://ebird.org/profile/MzQ1MjU0Mg), and bush walking. 

Currently a junior at Texas Tech University K-12 interning at
[Market Mapper](https://www.marketmapper.io/) doing all things content. My other site can be found [here](https://vintagemind.github.io/).

## Things I'm Interested In.

* Technical analysis: Enjoying the overlap of mathematics and financial markets.
  
* [Lightning Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network): I have a personal
  [node](https://github.com/raspiblitz/raspiblitz) and wish to be a fulltime node runner (why not?). It is the next
  payment system and you cannot convince me otherwise.
  
* [Security engineering](https://pentesterlab.com/profile/3c9762377542915b2cc2fbdf94): Personally, security engineering isn't something I want to pursue but having
  the mindset is extremely vital. I like to do [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/team/226953) whenever I have time with tendency to solve OSINT, web, and misc challs.
  I would say security engineering on decentralized protocols/applications to be the highest of difficulty. Smart contracts are a whole another monster.
  
* Applied cryptography: This is a field with insane complexity just like other rabbit holes. Currently learning on [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org/) but it will take me years to really grasp the knowledge with tons of practice. It's a very interesting topic with it being heavily tied to crypto wallets and protocols.

* Digital Signal Processing/Digital Image Processing: The mathematical rigor is on par with applied cryptography in all aspects. Just try it for yourself and you're smacked in the face with [linear system theory for continuous time systems, discrete time signals,](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~ssundara/courses/notes/linear_systems.pdf) systems theory, Z-transform, Laplace transform, Fourier transform, and down you go. Essentially engineering math. DSP is highly complementary to financial signal processing and can be even used to easily understand RF hacking.

* Economics/Political Sciences: I'm a student memember at [Mises Institute](https://mises.org/) which favors the Austrian School of Economics (a school of thought). Though I favor this ideology the most, the understanding of markets and market dynamics has always been an interest to me from a young age.
