<h1>I'm Bithiah.</h1>

A tinkerer, pleb, old soul. 

Known as by many anons on the World Wide Web. I like to fence, play chess, 
read books, do ornithology research, and bush walking. 

Enjoys the interrelationship of security + blockchain + finance/economics.

Currently a junior at Texas Tech University K-12 and threat analyst at [REDACTED]. 

## Things I'm Interested In.

* [Security engineering](https://pentesterlab.com/profile/3c9762377542915b2cc2fbdf94): I very interested specifically in browser security and opsec. In my free time, I like to do [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/team/226953) whenever I have time with tendency to solve OSINT, web, and misc challs. I would say security engineering on decentralized protocols/applications to be the highest of difficulty. Smart contracts are a whole another monster.

* [Lightning Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network): I have a personal
  [node](https://github.com/raspiblitz/raspiblitz) and wish to be a fulltime node runner (why not?). It is the next
  payment system and you cannot convince me otherwise.
  
* Applied cryptography: This is a field with insane complexity just like other rabbit holes. Currently learning on [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org/) but it will take me years to really grasp the knowledge with tons of practice. It's a very interesting topic with it being heavily tied to crypto wallets and protocols.

* Technical analysis: Enjoying the overlap of mathematics and financial markets.

* Digital Signal Processing/Digital Image Processing: The mathematical rigor is on par with applied cryptography in all aspects. Just try it for yourself and you're smacked in the face with [linear system theory for continuous time systems, discrete time signals,](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~ssundara/courses/notes/linear_systems.pdf) systems theory, Z-transform, Laplace transform, Fourier transform, and down you go. Essentially engineering math. DSP is highly complementary to financial signal processing and can be even used to easily understand RF hacking.

* Economics/Political Sciences: I'm a student memember at [Mises Institute](https://mises.org/) which favors the Austrian School of Economics (a school of thought). Though I favor this ideology the most, the understanding of markets and market dynamics has always been an interest to me from a young age. 

## Aspirations.

There are too many things to do, too many rabbit holes to jump into. End of the day, if I'm better than yesterday, I'm honestly happy.

My aim is to contribute to blockchain-based financial infustructure with the goal of strengthening the security for the new wave of finance and financial markets.  

## Ideology.

A pessimist and perfectionist when it comes to developing myself but optimistic of the future. 
Liberalism runs through my veins and nyctophilia made me an Australian owlet-nightjar.
