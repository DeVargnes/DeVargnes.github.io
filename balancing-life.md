title: How to balance work + school + extracurriculars?
---

Hey there! If you're like someone like me who needs to juggle a lot of things in a day, you've come to the right place :D

Do note, I attend [Texas Tech University K-12](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/k12/) as a junior in high school which is 100% online (the only exception being graduation is on the university campus in May). 
And I work fully remote (startup is in Israel).

***Schedule***

If you have a typical 9 to 5 job, here's a schedule that REALLY works:

5am - 9am: Study (4 hours)

9am - 5pm: Work (8 hours)

5pm - 8pm: Go to sports club/gym/extracurricular activity (3 hours)

8pm - 10pm: Study (2 hours)

10pm: Go to sleep


When trying to follow Israel Daylight Time for working hours:


5am - 1pm: Study (8 hours)

1pm - 4pm: Go to sports club/gym/extracurricular activity (3 hours)

4pm - 11pm: Work (7 hours)

11pm: Go to sleep


I personally structure my day as follows: 4 hours of study + 7 - 8 hours of work + 2 - 3 hours of study + 7 - 8 hours of sleep.

Many underestimate the value of sleep hence I make it mandatory to get at least 7 hours of sleep. Studies range from a total of 6 - 7 hours which is how long your typical school day is (at least in high school). 7 - 8 hours of work is pretty good. And I manage to fit in 3 hours of extracurricular activites and this can even consist of going out for walks, gym, etc.

As you can see, it's very much possible. 

***What about social life***

Of course, everything has its own disadvatnages, here being little to no social life. Honestly, doing online schooling and working remotely is not everyone's cup of tea and your personality also is very dependent to how well you can cope with this environment.

I really like this way of life. Friends my age are virtually non-existent and almost everyone I know is 25 and above years of age. 

***Tips***

If you are able to finish assignments faster or even work, it makes the situation much better. If the company you work for is flexible and only cares you finish the tasks on time and eosn't bother about your "attendance", make use of that. 

Focus on the work at hand. This is super important as it speeds about everything you do!

***What do you get by doing this?***

Honestly, a lot! And I mean A LOT. When you're 16 - 18, it's the peak time to learn and develop yourself. First choose the domain you're interested to work in the long run (for me that's blockchain technologies).

Then try to find ways in which you can actively work in that particular field. 

Many people ask me why work at this age and my simple answer is that I'm gaining real-world knowledge/experiences as well as learning what I things I can never learn at school or even in university to be honest.

My goal is not money at this age, it's getting the valuable exposure and knowledge.   




Hope you enjoyed reading!
