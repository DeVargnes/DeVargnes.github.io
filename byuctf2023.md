**Sanity Check (50)**
Who doesn't like the good ol' sanity check? Let me tell you, it took me a solid 5 mins to find the bloody flag!
If you go to the BYUCTF Discord server and go to #general, you need to the top of the channel page and you'll find the flag. It was hidden in plain sight for sooooo long.
