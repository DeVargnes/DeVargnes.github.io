This page is a collection of stuff I've done or made in a miscellaneous sense. Unfortunately the majority or almost all of high school I rarely created projects. I remember doing projects but I've never documentated them hence technically lost them.


## Technical Indicators

Making indicators with PineScript and publishing them on TradingView. Dedicated in mastering PineScript and just creating as many unique and creative indicators that solve different traders' requirements. Started officially in October and planning to continue doing till May (let's see how it goes).
