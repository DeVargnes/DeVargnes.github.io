This page is a collection of stuff I've done or made in a miscellaneous sense. Unfortunately the majority or almost all of high school I rarely created projects. I remember doing projects but I've never documentated them hence I technically lost them.


## Projects

[Technically Right Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/4hZQIBzJhR5wSNiGpKBcDj) - A podcast I set up for fun at Market Mapper since why not? (>_･ )ｸﾞ

[Mozilla TCP/ETP Project](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Support/TCP-ETP) - Identify and track site breakage issues caused by TCP/ETP and to collaborate with the product team on resolving them.

## Technical Indicators

Making indicators with PineScript and publishing them on TradingView.

[Two SMAs Simulatenously](https://www.tradingview.com/script/ltZt1zrj-Two-SMAs/)
