This page is a collection of stuff I've done or made in a miscellaneous sense. 


## Projects

[Technically Right Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/4hZQIBzJhR5wSNiGpKBcDj) - A podcast I set up for fun at Market Mapper since why not? (>_･ )ｸﾞ

[Mozilla TCP/ETP Project](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Support/TCP-ETP) - Identify and track site breakage issues caused by TCP/ETP and to collaborate with the product team on resolving them.

## Technical Indicators

Planning to make indicators with PineScript and publish them on TradingView ofc.
