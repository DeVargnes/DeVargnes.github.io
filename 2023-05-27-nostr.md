title: Nostr - Decentralized Social Network
---

Early this year I found out about Nostr and created a page [here](https://blockchain-with-vintagemind.gitbook.io/blockchain/guides-blog/setting-up-nostr) on how to set it up.

Nostr solves an interesting problem of true decentralized social network (psst Mastodon is fraud). First of, what makes a social network decentralized?


## Nostr vs Mastodon

Mastodon is good. It's part of the [federated universe](https://fediverse.party/) and it allows you to [self-host Mastodon servers](https://joinmastodon.org/servers). It's certainly a level better than the ultra-centralized social platforms like Twitter, etc. 
But there is a human that controls that server (most likely the one who hosts the server). It's decentralized in the sense that there is no central authority of all servers (something like Discord) but you have the idea of pods all over the Mastodon network.

Nostr is great on the other hand, it's just a protocol. Let me break it down. 

You have a nostr publick key and private key. Label them as npub and nsec. If you lose nsec, you won't be able to use nostr anymore with you npub "account". Every user is identified by their npub, creating their "account" or "profile".

Anyone can run relays which are some what like backend servers of Nostr. Of course, only go through trusted relays (some can be malicious). For detailed explanation of relays, see [here](https://nostr.com/relays).
I would closely relate  Nostr with Matrix as they are similar on many levels. The main difference between Nostr and every other social network is that you can zap users with sats through the lightning network.

## What does Nostr solve?

I believe we're still seeing the development of the protocol in full. Many are developing clients on top of nostr and contributing to the overall nostr community. Favourite clients are [Primal](https://primal.net/home) and [Plebstr](https://plebstr.com/#home). It solves the authenticity of the user (is not a bot, etc.) due to prominent nostr protocols such as NIP05. As well as transaction of money to individual users seamless using lightning and is censorship-resistant.
